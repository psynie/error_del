                I <b><i>love</i></b> you soo muchh my lovee <br>
                You’re the kind of person flowers would blush for. Where others see petals, 
                I see you gentle, warm, and impossible to forget. 
                My heart has its own garden, and somehow every bloom there looks like you.
